//The period is called ember access operator; it`s how you navigate
//from the class to one of its methods. While 'WriteLine' is a method. And
//finally, the 'Console' is the class in which the method writeline is called
//to print the words that we want.
//Remember: WriteLine() method prints the output with a new line after it, while
//Write() won't.
Console.WriteLine("This is the first line.");
Console.Write("This is ");
Console.Write("the second ");
Console.Write("line.");
//Using both techniques, this is what we get.
